2019-06-07: Complted index.html with bootstrap only. Need to further justify the looks 
            by using style.css

            It looks like I need to make 3 row x 3 col design 

 2019 06-08: restructure the grid system for bootstrap, only one level
             row 1: 1s,4,4,2s  (banner)
             row 2: 12s    (space)
             row 3: 2s,8,2s (title)
             row 4: 2s,8,2s (main area)
             row 5: 12s   (space)
             row 6: 12    (footer)

             Changed to 

             row 1: 1s,5,5,1s  (banner)
             row 2: 12s    (space)
             row 3: 1s,10,1s (title)
             row 4: 1s,10,1s (main area)
             row 5: 12s   (space)
             row 6: 12    (footer)

             matching the colors and fonts in index.html
