2019-06-07: Complted index.html with bootstrap only. Need to further justify the looks 
            by using style.css

            It looks like I need to make 3 row x 3 col design

             matching the colors and fonts in index.html
             adding one blue line at the bottom

            problem: 1. <hr> not good in small screem
                     2. Collapse menu is not shown
